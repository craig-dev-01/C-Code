# Craig-Codes

Hello. I'm glad you are visiting my repository! 

This is my personal repository to showcase my coding apptitude. My primary language is Java

I am currently a Junior student at UCCS pursuing my Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science.

Below is a brief description of my portfolio's contents. 

Currently I have 3 programs in my repo. To make running each program easier, I combined all of the classes for each program into one .java file. 

Programs: 
  
  VehicleTest: 
      This program has 6 classes and a test class. Additionally The vehicles.txt file is required to run the program. 
      This program is all about object-oriented programming 
 
  LogicExample:
      This program creates a file, fills it with random values, reads the values, loads them into arrays, and manually sorts the arrays before displaying array contents
      This program is all about building logic, reading and writing to files, and handling data.

  CraigStack:
   This program demonstrates stack operations using both the Java Collections Framework (JCF)
   and a custom generic stack class. It counts even integers in a JCF stack without modifying it,
   and performs generic stack manipulation including reading from files, combining stacks,
   sorting stacks, and removing duplicates. All operations are implemented for both Integer
   and String types using generic methods and a custom GenericStack<E> class. The GenericStack<E> 
   class is included in this java file.
