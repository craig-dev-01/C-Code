# Craig-Codes

Hello. I'm glad you are visiting my repository! 

This is my personal repository to showcase my coding apptitude. My primary language is Java

I am currently a sophomore student at UCCS pursuing my Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science.

Below is a brief description of my portfolio's contents. 

Currently I have two programs in my repo. To make running each program easier, I combined all of the classes for each program into one .java file. 

Programs: 
  Vehicle: 
      This program has 6 classes and a test class. Additionally The vehicles.txt file is required to run the program. 
      This program is all about object-oriented programming 
  Writer-Reader:
      This program creates a file, fills it with random values, reads the values, loads them into arrays, and manually sorts the arrays before displaying array contents
      This program is all about building logic, reading and writing to files, and handling data.
